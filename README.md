# Advanced Football Betting

Advanced football betting is an experimental software which aims at predicting the results of football matches based on past data. 

The software is divided into two main sections: `Predictions` and `API`. 

## `Predictions`
This section contains the models and the backtesting script to evaluate past performances.
The models are based on data collected from the following leagues: England, Germany, Italy and Spain, ranging from 2016 to 2020 (5 Seasons each).
Predictions will be made based on the output of a Classification Random Forest model with an Elo model.

## `API`
